# MagTagHallPass

This is for all of you teachers who are tired of writing hall passes! The **MagTag Hall Pass** will automatically fetch the current time from Adafruit IO and display it on the e-paper display. When the student returns, it can go into a deep sleep state, ready for the next user. I have not done extensive testing yet, but using one of the Adafruit Li-ion should provide several days of battery life (at least).
